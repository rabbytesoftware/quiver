# Quiver

Quiver is a **multi-platform, multi-paradigm package manager** - probably the only one you'll ever need! It's designed to make complex installation processes quick and easy for both technical and non-technical users, while keeping systems well-contained and manageable.

## What is Quiver?

Quiver is a universal package manager that handles networking, publishes a REST API for package management, and (most importantly) downloads and manages packages across any platform. Each package (called an "Arrow") can be anything from game servers to development tools, web applications, or system utilitiesâ€”all managed within the same app.

Quiver makes hard and long install processes quick and easy, keeps your systems well-contained without risky custom wizard software, and provides a global, multi-OS app store that allows anyone to upload content without borders.

## Current Development Status

Quiver is currently under heavy development, and we're aiming to deploy a demo by the end of **February 2026**. The demo will feature a simple real-time chat application, which will be released exclusively to our beta tester channels.

## Documentation

We have comprehensive documentation available on [Documentation README](docs/README.md)
